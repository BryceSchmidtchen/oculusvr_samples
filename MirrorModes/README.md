Oculus Rift DK2 mirror modes
================

This application introduces different ways to mirror the DK2 output to a window which can be used for debugging. Press 'M' while running the program to toggle between:
- standard mirror with DK2 distortion
- single-eye mirror (useful for detecting stereoscopic bugs)
- non-distorted mirror for convenience

A green rectangle will determine which eye is currently rendered in single eye mode.
